# AtmosphericScience
A bunch of scripts to help pre-process atmospheric science data. Please feel free to use anything that might be useful to you.
I wrote everything but the .m scripts, but I include those here for anyone doing similar research.

The .py scripts were also not written by me. I include them here for dependency purposes. You may need them in the same directory or your python path to 
get the scripts to run correctly.
